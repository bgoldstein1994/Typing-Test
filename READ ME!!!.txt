Project Name: Typing Test
Purpose: Greenway Health Challenge
Contents: Compiled application as well as source code.

To start the application, open "Typing Test.exe" located in the root directory.

This application allows a user to take a typing speed test which determines the
user's typing speed in words per minute.  To start a test, the user simply 
starts typing in the text box below the sample excerpt. The excerpt is one of 
fifteen that is randomly chosen. During the test, the status pane to right of 
the typing area displays the elapsed time as well as the amount of words the 
user has typed so far. After the test is concluded, the typing area displays 
all typing errors, hilighted in red. The status pane to the right of the typing
area shows the amount of time the test took, the amount of words the user 
typed, the user's typing speed, and the user's typing accuracy percentage. To 
start the test again, the user simply clicks the redo button in the status pane
and begins again.
